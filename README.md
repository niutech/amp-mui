# ⚡ AMP MUI CSS Framework

This is an [AMP](https://www.ampproject.org) version of the lightweight [MUI](https://www.muicss.com/) CSS framework by Andres Morey, inspired by Material Design. It complies with the  [AMP CSS spec](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/design/responsive/style_pages).

## Usage

Insert the contents of `mui.min.css` file into the `<style amp-custom></style>` tag. Remember to use `<amp-img>` instead of `<img>` tags in AMP HTML.

## Demo

Check out the [demo page](https://niutech.github.io/amp-mui/) as a valid AMP HTML document.

## Differences from MUI

 - Removed `!important  and `style=""` attributes
 - Removed overlay and ripple
 - Changed syntax for dropdowns and tabs
